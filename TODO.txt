 * Networking with support for drivers.
    - Port an IP stack:
      uIP (https://github.com/adamdunkels/uip)
      lwIP (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/)
    - SLIP-Serial port driver

 * PCI interface (required for USB suport)

 * USB: host controller driver and libUSB-like interface for API (or port libUSB).

 * Port AppOS to Arduino UNO & Leonardo (ATmega328P, ATmega32u4)

 * Port AppOS to RaspberryPI

 * Port AppOS to MSP430

 * Port AppOS to Microchip PIC 8 & 16 bits

 * Implement SMP for RasPI and PC.

 * Console driver for term.
 
 * Add event_register and event_send, to receive messages async. It will create a new task when event is received, passing data to it. The thread must end before it can receive another event.

 * Interface for other ports (SPI, I2C)
